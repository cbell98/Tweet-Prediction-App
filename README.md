# Tweet-Prediction-App
An app that predicts who tweeted what

The Tweet Prediction App allows you to input at least two Twitter users to the app.  Next, input a synthetic (fake) tweet and the app will predict 
which user is most likely to have posted the fake tweet.  The app uses a basic logistic regression model and the Twitter API (tweepy).
